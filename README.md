# Sample-Portfolio
## A very simple Portfolio app I built using react

I enrolled for Sidehustle Internship recently to learn React JS since it has always been on my list of things to learn. This react portfolio project
was given as a task for us in the Internship.

I made use of components and and props as well as some simple events and the bulk of code I wrote was in the css file. I would love to try out the styled component library in subsequent react projects.
